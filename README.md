Hi guys,

I'm Jodie and I'm old and being forced to take this Computer Competency class as part of my business management degree.  I'm totally lost and I hate this project.  I'm glad there are plenty of you out there, that love this stuff.  While I don't like coding this stuff, I do enjoy all the coding someone did on all of my devices.  Say a prayer for me please.
